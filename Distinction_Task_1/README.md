## About <a name = "about"></a>

Admins or Owners own property. They can own multiple properties which in turn have employees, customers and Billing [ the billing list includes the Electricity Bill, Water Bill and Gas Bill of the property ], the readings of these values can be read by IOT Devices ans stored into a database. The admin is therefore going to be able to read these data and observe the trend on the application.

The Owner can change the revenue stream (services/products) that each property offers, they can see sales trends to understand which streams have more popularity and even use this insight in making production decisions where applicable.
They'll be able to see their customers and what revenue streams they've subscribed to, Employees and what tasks they're assigned and also the billing expenditure from each property.
